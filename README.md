Here are the data for our paper "Elliptical graphical models for high dimensional microbiome data".
The sample population consists of 261 mice and can be divided into three groups according to the health conditions of the skin's immunizations: 78 nonimmunized controls (Control), 119 immunized healthy individuals (Healthy), and 64 immunized epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) individuals. We are interested in the core measurable microbiota (CMM).
